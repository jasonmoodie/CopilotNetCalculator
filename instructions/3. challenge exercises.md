# Challenge Exercises - Unit Testing

Welcome to the challenge exercises! In this section, you'll enhance the calculator application by adding comprehensive unit tests for the `CalculatorModel` class.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Learn how to write comprehensive unit tests using xUnit
- Practice testing edge cases and exception handling
- Understand the importance of test coverage
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises, ensure you have:
- Completed the core exercises
- Basic understanding of C# and ASP.NET Core MVC
- Familiarity with xUnit testing framework

## ðŸ”„ Run Tests to Review the Current CoveraGE

```powershell
# Navigate to the test project directory
cd MyCalculator.Tests

# Run all tests
dotnet test
```

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 1: Complete the Division Tests

The `CalculatorModelTests.cs` file currently has tests for Add, Subtract, and Multiply operations, but the Divide method tests are missing.

### Task 1.1: Add Basic Division Tests

Add unit tests for the `Divide` method in the `CalculatorModelTests.cs` file. Your tests should cover:

1. **Basic Division Test**: Test dividing two positive numbers
2. **Theory-Based Division Tests**: Test various input combinations using `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]`

**Expected test cases to include:**
- `10 Ã· 2 = 5`
- `15 Ã· 3 = 5`
- `-10 Ã· 2 = -5`
- `-15 Ã· -3 = 5`
- `7.5 Ã· 2.5 = 3`
- `0 Ã· 5 = 0`

### Task 1.2: Test Exception Handling

The `Divide` method throws a `DivideByZeroException` when the second operand is zero. Add tests to verify this behavior:

1. **Single Exception Test**: Use `Assert.Throws<DivideByZeroException>()` to test division by zero
2. **Exception Message Test**: Verify that the correct error message is thrown

**Test cases to include:**
- `5 Ã· 0` should throw `DivideByZeroException`
- `-10 Ã· 0` should throw `DivideByZeroException`
- Verify the exception message is "Operand2 cannot be zero."

## ðŸ”„ Testing Your Implementation

To run your tests:

```powershell
# Navigate to the test project directory
cd MyCalculator.Tests

# Run all tests
dotnet test
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic division tests, then add complexity
2. **Test Early, Test Often**: Write tests as you develop new features
3. **Think Like a User**: What inputs might break your calculator?
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Your test names should explain what they're testing
5. **Follow the AAA Pattern**: Keep your tests organized and readable
6. **Test Edge Cases**: Don't just test the happy path
7. **Verify Exception Messages**: Ensure error messages are helpful to users

## ðŸš€ Bonus Challenges

If you complete all exercises, try these bonus challenges:

1. **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests that test the controller and model together
2. **Mock Testing**: Learn about mocking and write tests using a mocking framework
3. **Async Testing**: If you add async methods, write tests for asynchronous operations
4. **Custom Assertions**: Create custom assertion methods for calculator-specific validations

Happy Testing! ðŸ§ªâœ¨
