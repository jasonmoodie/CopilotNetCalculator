# Core exercise

The following exercises will help you get started with GitHub Copilot. You must have completed the [setup instructions](<./1. setup.md>) before starting these steps.

## ðŸ”„ Exercise 1: Getting the application running

**Starting Point**: You should have the repo open in VSCode (or your supported IDE)

1. Press ```CTRL + ` ``` to open the terminal window in VS Code if it is not already open.

2. Enter ```dotnet restore``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to install the required dependencies.
    ```powershell
    # Run the restore command
    dotnet restore
    ```
**Let's start by running the application to learn what it does.**

3. Enter ```cd MyCalculator``` and then enter ```dotnet run``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to run the application.
    ```powershell
    # Navigate to the test project directory
    cd MyCalculator

    # Run the application
    dotnet run
    ```
4. Open the application ```http://localhost:5000/``` in your browser.

5. Do some simple calculations to show that the calculator is working as expected.

6. Close the browser window for now and return to your code.

7. Ensure your focus is in the terminal window and press ``` CTRL + C ``` to stop the application.

## ðŸš€ Exercise 2: Adding features using GitHub Copilot

**TO DO** - You've been asked to add a new feature to the calculator application.

Currently, the calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Your task is to add a **power** operation that will allow users to calculate exponential values (e.g., 3^2 = 9).

### Adding the buttons to the calculator UI

1. Open the ```Views/Calculator/Index.cshtml``` file in the editor window.

2. Scroll down to where you see the empty button (around line 38): ```<button class="calc-btn" ></button>```

3. Replace this empty button with a power button. Start typing the following line to replace the empty button. You should see GitHub Copilot start to autocomplete as you type. When you see the power function, press ```TAB``` to accept the completion.

```html
<!-- TODO: Update button here  -->
<button class="calc-btn" data-action="power">^</button>
```

4. Save the file.

### Adding the logic for the new features

5. Open the ```Models/CalculatorModel.cs``` file in the editor window.

6. Scroll down to where you see the existing methods (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).

7. Press **ENTER** at the end of the last method and start typing the following. Notice that GitHub Copilot should start to offer code completion as you're typing. Press **TAB** to accept the suggestion.

```csharp
// TODO: Add method here
public double Power()
{
    return Math.Pow(Operand1, Operand2);
}
```

8. Open the ```Controllers/CalculatorController.cs``` file in the editor window.

9. Scroll down to where you see the switch statement with the operations (around line 20).

10. Move your cursor to the end of the "Divide" case (after the ```break;```) and press **ENTER**.

GitHub Copilot should display ghost text suggesting a new case for "Power". Press **TAB** to accept the suggestion:

```csharp
// TODO: Add case here
case "Power":
    model.Result = model.Power();
    break;
```

11. Open the ```wwwroot/js/calculator.js``` file in the editor window.

12. Look for the event handlers for the calculator operations and add support for the power operation. GitHub Copilot should help you add the appropriate JavaScript code to handle the power button click.

```javascript
function calculate() {
...
// TODO: Add operator
case 'power': result = Math.pow(operand, curr); break;


document.querySelectorAll('.calc-btn').forEach(btn => {
...
// TODO: Add operator
case 'power': setOperator('power'); break;
```

13. Press ```CTRL + ` ``` to open the terminal window in VS Code.

14. Enter ```cd MyCalculator``` and then enter ```dotnet run``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to run the application.

15. You should test the new button by entering 3, then clicking the "^" (power) button, then enter 2. The result should be 9.

16. Close the browser window, return to the Terminal window in VS Code and press ```CTRL+C``` to terminate the application.

**Success**, you have enhanced the calculator application using GitHub Copilot!

> Hopefully your calculator is working! Remember, GitHub Copilot is probabilistic so you may not get the exact same code suggestions as we did. If you're not happy with the suggestions, you can always press **CTRL + Z** to undo the changes and try again.

#### What's next?
You're now ready to start the [challenge exercises](<./3. challenge exercises.md>) to see how you can leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to solve a number of challenges yourself.
